# Vladyslav Bukator's Public Projects 📂  

## Overview 🚀  

Welcome to my public project repository! Here, you'll find some of my **best work**, and this collection will **continue to grow** as I develop new projects. While many of my projects are still **a work in progress** in private repositories, these are the main ones that I'm particularly proud of:  

### 🔹 Featured Projects  
- **Java Minigame 🎮** – A small but engaging minigame built with Java, based on Clash between Heroes and Bosses.
- **Functioning Calendar Website 📆** – A fully functional calendar web application designed for seamless scheduling.
- **Samsung Laptop Showcase 🌐** – A website presenting a Samsung laptop with a polished and professional layout.

This repository will **gradually expand** with more projects, so stay tuned for updates! 🚧✨
